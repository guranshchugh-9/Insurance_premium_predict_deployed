There is an insurance dataset and we have to predict the insurance premium category whether
low ,medium or high.

1. make the machine learning model 
2. the frontend of the model 
3. an api to connect the frontend and the model using fastapi

AFTER MAKING THE MODEL
After the ML model is made, then make the api in whcih i have to send the data from the user to 
the model, then find all the new features in the backend like bmi etc then after getting the output
send it back the frontend.
